# 🚀 Enterprise Document Tracking System (DTS)

**A Smart, Secure, and Simple Way to Manage Your Business Documents.**

STOP losing files in email chains. STOP wondering "who has the contract?".
This system is a **virtual filing cabinet** that organizes your company's documents, tracks who is working on them, and ensures nothing ever gets lost. It works like email, but smarter.

## 💼 Why Business Owners Love This App

### 1. **It Saves You Time (Smart Automation)**
The system uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to "read" your documents as you type. If you write about a price, it automatically tags it as "Finance". If you write "ASAP", it marks it "Urgent". You don't have to organize it—the system does it for you.

### 2. **Professional & Easy on the Eyes**
*   **Modern Design**: It looks and feels like a premium app (like iPhone apps), with 3D button effects.
*   **Dark Mode**: One click to switch to "Night Mode" so your team can work late without eye strain.

### 3. **Total Control & Security**
*   **Audit Trails**: See exactly *who* opened a file and *when*. No more "I didn't see that" excuses.
*   **Permissions**: The "Boss" sees everything. The "Intern" sees only what they need. You decide.

### 4. **Instant Reports**
